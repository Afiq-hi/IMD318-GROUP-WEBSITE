      <h2><b>About Our Shop</b></h2>
      <p>
        Florescent Florist began as a small dream blooming in the heart of us being a passionate flower lover. <br>
        Founded in 2022, our shop started with a simple goal – to bring beauty, color, and joy into people’s lives through the art of flowers. <br>
        What began as a tiny corner stall has now blossomed into a cozy, full-service florist known for unique arrangements, friendly service, and fresh blooms for every occasion. <br>
        Whether it's a grand wedding or a simple "just because" bouquet, we believe every flower tells a story – and we’re here to help you tell yours.<br>
        At Florescent Florist, we don’t just sell flowers – we share moments, memories, and a little bit of happiness with every stem.
